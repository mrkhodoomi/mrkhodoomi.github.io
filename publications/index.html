								<td><b>Abstract:</b> Due to the increasing environmental problems, the use of renewable energy is crucial; one of the best systems that help to use more of these sources in homes is the peer-to-peer energy trade. This paper investigates the peer-to-peer energy trading under uncertainty of renewable energy and peers' demand. To handle these uncertainties, this paper uses cardinality constrained robust optimization approach and it is solved to minimize the overall costs of energy trading, battery depreciation, and load shedding by the Alternating Direction Method of multiplier Predictor method. This robust mathematical model considers peers which are equipped by dispersed generations and a battery, and also central battery storage in the local grid. Moreover, the Nash bargaining theory is modeled to calculate energy prices that trade among peers, and their energy trading payment which boost mutually beneficial and encourage peers’ participation. Finally, a case study is conducted in Iran to show the effectiveness and superiority of the presented model that shows using peer-to-peer energy trading not only can save significant power but also makes notable profits for peers.</td>

								<td><b>Abstract:</b> The coronavirus pandemic has affected most aspects of product supply and consumer behaviors and led to transformations in the supply chain. COVID-19 pandemic and the requirements to reduce its prevalence have led many people to shop online and encouraged many manufacturers to sell their products online. In this paper, a manufacturer, who intends to possess an online sales channel, and a retailer, who has an in-person sales channel, are considered. Then, pricing strategies and collaboration mechanisms between the two sales channels of this health-social dual-channel supply chain are also investigated. This problem is developed in three models, including centralized, decentralized and collaborated under Stackelberg's game, whereas the optimal price of products in each channel, level of implementation of health and safety protocols in retailers, advertising level, and status of online shopping performance are obtained for improving customer trust. Indeed in this paper, the demand is represented as a function of selling prices (online and in-person), compliance level of health protocols, level of online shopping performance, and advertising in health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the centralized model provides more profit for the manufacture, the collaborated model provides the highest profit for the retailer. Thus, since the supply chain profit of centralized and collaborated models is close, the collaboration model is the best option for members in this situation. Sensitivity analysis is finally performed to evaluate the impact of key parameters, and then according to obtained results, some management insights are suggested for the dual-channel supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic.</td>

								<td><b>Abstract:</b> The coronavirus has had many effects on supply chains and logistics, most of which are negative. Due to the importance of logistics and supply chain in the world, any disruption or mismanagement causes many problems not only in the countries directly affected but also globally. In this article, new textual data are collected from reputable commercial and news websites related to the effects of COVID-19 on logistics and supply chains. After collecting textual data, valuable information about the  impact of the coronavirus is extracted using various text mining techniques  performed with R programming. Finally, issues related to COVID-19 and supply chains are identified and divided into five categories: suppliers and products, governments and organizations, health, evaluation, problems, and barriers. Also, categorizing the problems and limitations of supply chains and logistics will provide managerial insights  to minimize obstacles and disruptions.</td>

								<td><b>Abstract:</b> During the coronavirus epidemic food supply chains have been affected by disruptions of this epidemic. Having an overview and considering food-related factors such as energy, waste, and water makes the designing of the supply chain more effective. In this paper, a multi-objective model for sustainable food supply chain is presented based on prevalence of coronavirus by considering food-energy-water-waste nexus. There are dual-channel sales including online and in-person channels, which their demand functions depend on products price in every channel, as well as the prevalence of coronavirus in high-risk or low-risk areas. In fact, distribution centers located in high-risk regions require disinfection of products to minimize coronavirus spread. On the other hand, the type of vehicle is determined in this model to minimize not only the environmental impact, but also the delivery time. To validate the proposed model, the model is finally implemented in a two-channel supply chain in Iran.</td>

								<td><b>Abstract:</b> In the competitive market, applying effective and efficient inventory control and order management methods to reduce costs and improve service efficiency and quality, leading to profit maximization, becomes an absolute necessity at the organizational and supply chain level. Therefore, this study used the optimal control theory to propose an order system and inventory management model. The model is presented from the company’s resourcing stage with a desirable accountability level from the supplier side in a continuous review period with dynamic multi-item demand and budget constraints. In the present model, the order was regarded as a time-dependent function and a control variable. In addition, the need for each item is time-dependent and specified. The present model indicates the order and inventory system as an optimal control problem. In addition, Pontryagin’s maximum principle for optimal control problems, Generalized Reduced Gradient Method (GRG), and Kuhn–Tucker conditions were used to seek the optimal order. The model aimed to maximize the total order profit and inventory management systems. Finally, the results were presented numerically and graphically, and some management decisions were derived.

								<td><b>Abstract:</b> Nowadays, due to highly competitive markets, meeting customer demand, quickly with the best quality and lowest cost, has become inevitable and achievable with the optimal utilization of resources and facilities. Just in Time (JIT) production system is an effective strategy to that end. Various measures and factors are involved in implementing JIT in the supply chain. The identification and analysis can give managers a clear vision of the supply chain and JIT so that this system can be implemented with the best performance in organizations. In this study, the most significant and effective measures involved in JIT were identified. Then the importance and priority of these measures were determined in terms of impact on JIT's performance. Moreover, the relationship between measures and their effectiveness was determined. The research results can be applied for the efficient implementation of JIT. The information-feedback and purchasing unit factors were correlated to all other factors, indicating that such factors require special attention in organizations. It was also found that customers had the most negligible impact on JIT. In general, three factors of purchasing unit, information-feedback, and sales unit were considered as independent factors, and the other three factors – including manufacturing unit, suppliers, and customers – were dependent. Also, the ISM approach categorized the factors into three levels. The purchasing unit directly affected information feedback and sales unit factors. Then these two factors affected the factors at level 1, i.e., the manufacturing unit, customers, and suppliers; hence, these three factors had the most impressibility.
